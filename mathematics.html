    <h1>Master's Programme in Mathematics</h1>

    The Master's Degree in Mathematics at the University of Ljubljana is a second cycle Bologna degree with 120 ECTS.
      To enrol, you need a first cycle Bologna degree (or equivalent) in Mathematics or a related field.

    <h2>Courses</h2>
    <p>
      The department offers a wide selection of semester-long courses, and you are free to select the ones that suit
      your background and goals. There are only two requirements: you need to pass either Measure Theory
      or Introduction to Functional Analysis, and you need to pass at least one class from four of the following
      five fields: Algebra / Discrete Mathematics, Geometry / Topology, Numerical Mathematics,
      Financial Mathematics / Probability / Statistics, and Theoretical Computer Science. You can also take up to 4
      courses from other programmes offered by the University of Ljubljana.
    </p>
    <p><a href="courses.html">Here</a> is a list of all the courses we are offering in the academic year 2015/16, and a list of all Master's level courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students typically choose 5 courses in the first three semesters, and one in
      the fourth semester. Most courses have 3 hours a week of lectures and 2 hours a week of problem sessions. In
      applied courses, there are 2 hours a week of lectures and 2 hours a week of problem sessions, and you need to
      choose and complete a project, usually involving some programming.
    </p>

    <h2>Thesis and Master's exam</h2>
    <p>
      All students have to write a Master's thesis, an exposé of a chosen topic on roughly 50 pages. The student picks an advisor, who helps him or her choose the topic and ensures that the thesis is up to the standards required by the department. The thesis can also be submitted in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before graduation, the students also have to pass the Master's exam, answering one question from Analysis, one
      question from Algebra, and one question from a chosen field (Advanced Analysis, Advances Algebra, Geometry and
      Topology, Probability and Statistics, Numerical Mathematics, Discrete Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science).
