<h1>Master's Programme in Computer Science and Mathematics</h1>

The Master's Degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Ljubljana is a second cycle Bologna degree with 120 ECTS. It is run jointly by the Department of Mathematics and the Faculty of Computer and Information Science. To enrol, you need a first cycle Bologna degree (or equivalent) in Mathematics, Computer Science or a related field.

<h2>Courses</h2>
      <p>
        The Department of Mathematics and the Faculty of Computer and Information Science offer a wide selection of semester-long courses, and you are free to select the ones that suit
        your background and goals. The compulsory courses are Programming and Algorithms. You also need to select at least 7 pure mathematics or computer science courses offered by the Department of Mathematics, and at least 5 other courses offered by the Faculty of Computer and Information Science. Two courses can be selected from other Master's level programmes offered by the University of Ljubljana.
