<p>
  Our department is large and diverse, with roughly 70 professors and teaching assistants, and we cover <br/>
  all major fields of mathematics such as Complex Analysis, Global Analysis, Functional Analysis, Algebra,
  Topology, Numerical Mathematics, Graph Theory, Combinatorics, Theoretical Computer Science, Mechanics, Financial
  Mathematics, Probability and Statistics. We pride ourselves on being not just good mathematicians, but also
  friendly and accommodating to our students. Mathematics is hard enough as it is!
</p>
<p>
  The department also organizes 11 weekly research seminars and a monthly colloquium.
</p>
<p>
  The following are some of the professors who teach our Master's degree courses. In the Financial Mathematics Programme, classes are often taught by visiting professors.
