      <h1>The Programme</h1>

      <p>
        A Master's Degree in Mathematics is an excellent career choice, whether you want to pursue a Ph.D. in
        Mathematics and a career in research and academia, or if you want to find a job in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Master's Degree in Mathematics at the University of Ljubljana is a second cycle Bologna degree with 120 ECTS.
        To enroll, you need a first cycle Bologna degree (or equivalent) in Mathematics or a related field.
      </p>

      <h2>Courses</h2>
      <p>
        The department offers a wide selection of semester-long courses, and you are free to select the ones that suit
        your background and goals. There are only two requirements: you need to pass either Measure Theory or
        Introduction to Functional Analysis, and you need to pass at least one class from four of the following five
        fields: Algebra and Discrete Mathematics, Geometry/Topology, Numerical Mathematics, Financial Mathematics/
        Probability/Statistics, and Theoretical Computer Science. You can also take a limited number of courses from
        other programmes offered by the University of Ljubljana.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most courses are worth 6 ECTS, and students typically choose 5 courses in the first three semesters, and one in
        the fourth semester. Most courses have 3 hours a week of lectures and 2 hours a week of problem sessions. In
        applied courses, there are 2 hours a week of lectures and 2 hours a week of problem sessions, and you need to
        choose and complete a project, usually involving some programming.
      </p>

      <h2>Thesis and Master's exam</h2>
      <p>
        All students have to write a Master's thesis, an exposé of a chosen topic on roughly 50 pages. The thesis is
        worth 25 ECTS. The student picks an advisor, who helps him or her choose the topic and ensures that the thesis
        is up to the standards required by the department.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before graduation, the students also have to pass the Master's exam, answering one question from Analysis, one
        question from Algebra, and one question from a chosen field (Advanced Analysis, Advances Algebra, Geometry and
        Topology, Probability and Statistics, Numerical Mathematics, Discrete Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science).
      </p>

      <h2>Language</h2>
      <p>
        We realize that you probably don't speak Slovenian. That's OK! All our professors speak English, and will
        lecture in English if there is at least one foreign student in the class. The thesis can also be submitted in
        English.
