<h1>Master's Programme in Mathematics</h1>

<p>The Master's Degree in Mathematics at the University of Ljubljana is a second
cycle Bologna degree with 120 ECTS.  To enrol, you need a first cycle Bologna
degree (or equivalent) in Mathematics or a related field.</p>

<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>The department offers a wide selection of semester-long courses, and you
are free to select the ones that suit your background and goals. There are only
two requirements: you need to pass either Measure Theory or Introduction to
Functional Analysis, and you need to pass at least one class from four of the
following five fields: Algebra / Discrete Mathematics, Geometry / Topology,
Numerical Mathematics, Financial Mathematics / Probability / Statistics, and
Theoretical Computer Science. You can also take up to 4 courses from other
programmes offered by the University of Ljubljana.</p>
<p><a href="courses.html">Here</a> is a list of all the courses we are offering
in the academic year 2015/16, and a list of all Master's level courses.</p>
<p>Students typically choose 5 courses in the first three semesters, and one
in the fourth semester. Most courses have 3 hours a week of lectures and 2
hours a week of problem sessions. In applied courses, there are 2 hours a week
of lectures and 2 hours a week of problem sessions, and you need to choose and
complete a project, usually involving some programming.</p>

<h2>Thesis and Master's exam</h2>
<p>All students have to write a Master's thesis, an expos&eacute; of a chosen topic
on roughly 50 pages. The student picks an advisor, who helps him or her choose
the topic and ensures that the thesis is up to the standards required by the
department. The thesis can also be submitted in English.</p>
<p>Before graduation, the students also have to pass the Master's exam,
answering one question from Analysis, one question from Algebra, and one
question from a chosen field (Advanced Analysis, Advances Algebra, Geometry and
Topology, Probability and Statistics, Numerical Mathematics, Discrete
Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science).</p>
