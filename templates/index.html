<p>A Master's Degree in Mathematics is an excellent career choice,
whether you want to pursue a PhD <br /> in Mathematics and a career in
research and academia, or if you want to find a job in the industry.
</p>


<h2>Programmes offered</h2>
<p>We offer three Master's degree programmes, all of which consist of a
number of (mostly elective) courses and a Master's thesis. To enrol, you
need a first cycle Bologna degree (or equivalent) in Mathematics or a
related field.<br /></p>
<p>Our core programme is <a href="mathematics.html">Master's Programme
  in Mathematics</a>. This is the best choice for students with an
interest in pure mathematics, for those who wish to pursue a PhD degree,
and for those who want maximal flexibility in the selection of courses.
</p>
<p>If you want to work in the financial industry, your best choice might
be our <a href="financial_mathematics.html">Master's Programme in
  Financial Mathematics</a>. In addition to courses in Probability,
Statistics and Financial Mathematics, students also take some courses at
the Faculty of Economics and some pure mathematics courses.</p>
<p>For students with a pronounced interest in computer science, we
recommend <a href="computer_science.html">Master's Programme in Computer
  Science and Mathematics</a>. This is a programme run jointly by our
department and the Faculty of Computer and Information Science.  </p>
<p><a href="courses.html">Here</a> is a list of all the courses we are
offering in the academic year 2015/16, and a list of all Master's level
courses.</p>


<h2>Why Ljubljana?</h2>
<p> At our department, we are very proud that we offer first-class and
accessible mathematics education. Please read more about our
<a href="professors.html">professors</a>, and about the
<a href="costs.html">costs</a>.</p>

<p> Ouprogramme offers many pure mathematics courses, and also many applied
courses that give our students an edge when it comes to applying for jobs
in the industry (programming, data science, financial industry etc.).</p>

<p>We are also very proud of our city &ndash;
<a href="ljubljana.html">Ljubljana</a> is a wonderful place to live in!</p>


<h2>Are you a good match for the programme?</h2>

<p>We realise that you probably don't speak Slovene, and that two years
is a short time to master a language. There is, however, nothing to worry
about. All our professors speak English, and will lecture in English if
there are students in class who don't speak Slovene. Living in Ljubljana,
you will also easily get by with little or no Slovene.</p>

<p>Our programme is of high quality and quite demanding, so you need to
have motivation and a proper background to do well. If your undergraduate
preparation is not sufficient, you may have to pass 	additional courses
before you can enrol, so do send us an
<a href="mailto:masters@fmf.uni-lj.si">e-mail</a> if you are unsure.</p>
