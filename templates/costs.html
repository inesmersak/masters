<%block name="title"> &ndash; Costs</%block>
<p>We all know that good education can be expensive. Luckily, it doesn't have
to be.</p>
<p>If you are a citizen of an EU country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia,
or Montenegro, <strong>tuition is waived</strong>.  <br />
For most other students, tuition is 2,800 euros per year; however, the
department is able to waive or reduce the tuition for excellent students upon
request.</p>
<p>The other major expenses are room and board. A room in a dormitory costs
roughly 150 euros a month; <br /> expect to pay a bit more if you rent a room
off-campus, and 300-400 euros per month to rent <br /> a small apartment.</p>
<p>One of the greatest student perks in Slovenia is that you get
<strong>subsidised meals</strong> &ndash; and not just in student cafeterias,
but in a wide selection of restaurants in Ljubljana and elsewhere, more than
500 in fact! <br /> Whether you fancy some typical Slovenian dishes, Italian,
Mexican or Asian food, you can get two full meals <br /> a day, typically for
just 2-4 euros. Check out the selection at <a

<p>If you are a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo,
Macedonia or Serbia, you might be eligible for a <strong>scholarship</strong>
that covers living costs in the amount of 700 euros per month (and tuition if
you are not eligible for a waiver).  See <a

of applications.</p>
<p>It is also quite easy for our students to get a <strong>part-time
  job</strong> as a programmer, tutor etc. – it helps cover <br />
the expenses, and it's a great way to boost your CV and smooth your transition
into the workforce.</p>
